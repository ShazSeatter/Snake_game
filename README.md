# Brief

<b> MVP </b>

- Snake should be able to grow by eating the food that appears on the screen
- Food to appear in random places on the screen once it has been eaten by the snake
- Snake movement logic: left, right, up, down but also the snake cannot move back onto itself
- Game over logic: hitting walls or eating itself
- Score tracker to display score and game over message
